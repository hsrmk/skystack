I am working on a Next.js React Project deployed on Vercel, with Tailwind CSS for styling and sometimes for specific components I use ui/shadcn.

For colors, always use Tailwind CSS primitive colors, unless specified.

Before implementing and starting to code, always ask geniuine questions? (Please no made up questions, just for the sake of asking questions, only geniune questions regarding implementations etc.)
