I am working on a Next.js React Project deployed on Vercel, with Tailwind CSS for styling and sometimes for specific components I use ui/shadcn.

For colors, always use Tailwind CSS primitive colors, unless specified. Always use "@/" to reference imports.

Before implementing and starting to code, always ask geniuine questions? (Please no made up questions, just for the sake of asking questions, only geniune questions regarding implementations etc.)

Before starting to implementing in code, make sure you understand what I'm asking for. You can probe a little deeper on the nitty gritty if you didnt understand. No need to straight away go and implement.
